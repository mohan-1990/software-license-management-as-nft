# software license-management-as-nft

This project aims bring software and mobile apps license management onto a public blockchain platform. Software and mobile apps license could be represented as ERC721 - non fungible tokens and this approach is already gaining popularity among software product vendors (Reference- https://medium.com/spendee/nfts-the-future-of-software-licensing-digital-ownership-6bc42568cb72)

This project is work in progress. Please refer below technical roadmap for progress and components to be built.
